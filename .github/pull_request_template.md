## 🫶 Reviewer's Companion

<!--

The Reviewer's Companion is a guide to help both reviewers and developers collaborate effectively during the code review process. It provides best practices and tips for conducting a thorough and constructive review.

-->

**To ensure a successful review, please follow these guidelines:**

- Current branch is **up to date** with target branch.
- **Follow the team standards [#code](https://coda.io/d/CS-Team-Engineering-Processes_drG9bXq7N6M/Code-standards-and-patterns_suVCR)**.
- **Keep it simple, sweetie (KISS)**. Simplify your code by removing unnecessary complexity or redundancy.
- **Don't repeat yourself (DRY)**. Avoid duplicating code by extracting common functionality into reusable functions or modules.
- **No private customer data** is shown in code.
- **Document your code**. see [here](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/inline-documentation-standards/javascript/).
- **Avoid unnecessary comments**. Comments should only be used to explain complex or unusual code.
- **Remove unintentional logs**. Logs left behind after debugging can be a security and performance risk, so be sure to remove them before committing your code.
